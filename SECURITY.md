# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project is not mature or large to have the need to segment and provide backports of patches to older versions.
Patch versions will be used within the current release to denote bugfixes, which include vulnerability corrections.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please, reach out directly to me. Do not open a public ticket for security vulnerability until a deadline has been reached and it is clear that
I have not been responsive or responsible with the disclosure. Remember that this is a small projects that could see application in a wide
swath of sensitive environments. Security through obscurity is not security, but ... it briefly helps.
