Rust's Medical Toolkit is a toolkit being developed to put together a set of tools and libraries to facilitate communication and automation in medicine. 

# Goal
To create a simple toolkit with the necessary libraries, dependencies, and utilities for managing standard tasks in Medical IT. 
Also, I would like the project to make it more accessible for hospital to enable interoperability between systems. 
The toolkit will focus on increasing security and simplicity with the first step taken by starting the project using Rust.
The toolkit shall foster reliability and will make attempts to be standards compliant.
